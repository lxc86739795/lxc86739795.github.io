## Research

### Gait Recognition in the Wild with dense 3D Representations ([More Details](https://gait3d.github.io/))
Existing studies for gait recognition are dominated by 2D representations like the silhouette or skeleton of the human body in constrained scenes. However, humans live and walk in unconstrained 3D space, so projecting the 3D human body onto the 2D plane will discard a lot of crucial information like the viewpoint, shape, and dynamics for gait recognition. Therefore, this paper aims to explore dense 3D representations for gait recognition in the wild, which is a practical yet neglected problem. In particular, we propose a novel framework to explore the 3D Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model of the human body for gait recognition, named SMPLGait. Our framework has two elaborately designed branches of which one extracts appearance features from silhouettes, the other learns knowledge of 3D viewpoints and shapes from the 3D SMPL model. With the learned 3D knowledge, the appearance features from arbitrary viewpoints can be normalized in the latent space to overcome the extreme viewpoint changes in the wild scenes. In addition, due to the lack of suitable datasets, we build the first large-scale 3D representation-based gait recognition dataset, named Gait3D. It contains 4,000 subjects and over 25,000 sequences extracted from 39 cameras in an unconstrained indoor scene. More importantly, it provides 3D SMPL models recovered from video frames which can provide dense 3D information of body shape, viewpoint, and dynamics. Furthermore, it also provides 2D silhouettes and keypoints that can be explored for gait recognition using multi-modal data. Based on Gait3D, we comprehensively compare our method with existing gait recognition approaches, which reflects the superior performance of our framework and the potential of 3D representations for gait recognition in the wild.

### Progressive Vehicle Search in Larve-scale Surveillance Networks ([More Details](http://vehiclereid.github.io/VeRi/))
Compared with person re-identification, which has concentrated attention, vehicle re-identification is an important yet frontier problem in video surveillance and has been neglected by the multimedia and vision communities. 
Since most existing approaches mainly consider the general vehicle appearance for re-identification while overlooking the distinct vehicle identifier, such as the license number plate, they attain suboptimal performance. 
In this work, we propose PROVID, a PROgressive Vehicle re-IDentification framework based on deep neural networks. 
In particular, our framework not only utilizes the multi-modality data in large-scale video surveillance, such as visual features, license plates, camera locations, and contextual information, but also considers vehicle re-identification in two progressive procedures: coarse-to-fine search in the feature domain, and near-to-distant search in the physical space. 
Furthermore, to evaluate our progressive search framework and facilitate related research, we construct the VeRi dataset, which is the most comprehensive dataset from real-world surveillance videos. 
It not only provides large numbers of vehicles with varied labels and sufficient cross-camera recurrences but also contains license number plates and contextual information. 
Extensive experiments on the VeRi dataset demonstrate both the accuracy and efficiency of our progressive vehicle re-identification framework.

### Multi-grained Vehicle Parsing from Images([More Details](./MVP.md))
We present a novel large-scale dataset, Multi-grained Vehicle Parsing (MVP), for semantic analysis of vehicles in the wild, which has several featured properties.
First of all, the MVP contains 24,000 vehicle images captured in read-world surveillance scenes, which makes it more scalable than existing datasets.
Moreover, for different requirements, we annotate the vehicle images with pixel-level part masks in two granularities, i.e., the coarse annotations of ten classes and the fine annotations of 59 classes.
The former can be applied to object-level applications such as vehicle Re-Id, fine-grained classification, and pose estimation, while the latter can be explored for high-quality image generation and content manipulation.
Furthermore, the images reflect the complexity of real surveillance scenes, such as different viewpoints, illumination conditions, backgrounds, etc.
In addition, the vehicles have diverse countries, types, brands, models, and colors, which makes the dataset more diverse and challenging.
A codebase for person and vehicle parsing can be found [HERE](https://github.com/lxc86739795/human_vehicle_parsing_platform).

### Fine-grained Human Parsing in Images
This paper focuses on fine-grained human parsing in images. 
This is a very challenging task due to the diverse person's appearance, semantic ambiguity of different body parts and clothing, and extremely small parsing targets. 
Although existing approaches can achieve significant improvement through pyramid feature learning, multi-level supervision, and joint learning with pose estimation, human parsing is still far from being solved. 
Different from existing approaches, we propose a Braiding Network, named BraidNet, to learn complementary semantics and details for fine-grained human parsing. 
The BraidNet contains a two-stream braid-like architecture.
The first stream is a semantic abstracting net with a deep yet narrow structure which can learn semantic knowledge by a hierarchy of fully convolution layers to overcome the challenges of diverse person appearance. 
To capture low-level details of small targets, the detail-preserving net is designed to exploit a shallow yet wide network without down-sampling, which can retain sufficient local structures for small objects. 
Moreover, we design a group of braiding modules across the two sub-nets, by which complementary information can be exchanged during end-to-end training. 
Besides, at the end of BraidNet, a Pairwise Hard Region Embedding strategy is proposed to eliminate the semantic ambiguity of different body parts and clothing. 
Extensive experiments show that the proposed BraidNet achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art methods for fine-grained human parsing.

### Social Relation Recognition in Videos
Discovering social relations, e.g., kinship, friendship, etc., from visual content can make machines better interpret the behaviors and emotions of human beings. 
Existing studies mainly focus on recognizing social relations from still images while neglecting another important media—video. 
On the one hand, the actions and storylines in videos provide more important cues for social relation recognition. 
On the other hand, the key persons may appear at arbitrary spatial-temporal locations, even not in the same image from beginning to end. 
To overcome these challenges, we propose a Multi-scale Spatial-Temporal Reasoning (MSTR) framework to recognize social relations from
videos. 
For the spatial representation, we not only adopt a temporal segment network to learn global action and scene information but also design a Triple Graphs model to capture visual relations between persons and objects. 
For the temporal domain, we propose a Pyramid Graph Convolutional Network to perform temporal reasoning with multi-scale receptive fields, which can obtain both long-term and short-term storylines in videos. 
By this means, MSTR can comprehensively explore the multi-scale actions and storylines in spatial-temporal dimensions for social relation reasoning in videos. 
Extensive experiments on a new large-scale Video Social Relation dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
The dataset can be downloaded from [BaiduPan (~57GB, download code: jzei)](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1zeH2qeZZVRu__Kg-M5hJuw).
